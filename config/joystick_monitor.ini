	comment = the vid (vendor id) and pid (product id) are used to identify the device.  Together, these forn a unique address; the software can not differentiate between two devices with identical pid and vid
	comment = they both have four digit hexadecimal values
	comment = both are required.
	vid = 3344
	pid = C0CC
	.
	comment = axies: axis label (x, y or z) = major field, minor field, description (ignored), invert (or reverse) reading, calibration of on-screen image
	comment = if axis is present, then major and minor fields are required, other fields are optional
	x = 2,1, roll, true, 8
	y = 4,3, pitch, true
	comment = note axies rx, ry, rz, slider_0 and slider_1 are recognised and monitored, but not yet displayed
	.
	comment = col is required, it is used when displaying the device s avatar
	col = 1
	.
	comment = buttons: the fields that contain button responces (up to 8 buttons per field)
	buttons = 21, 22, 23, 24, 25
	.
	comment = echo_x, echo_y, echo_z: the vid and pid of a device to override an axis in this device.
	comment = Note: echo_x would copy the other device s x value into this device s x value
	echo_z = 3344 01F8
